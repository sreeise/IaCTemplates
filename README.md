# Infrastructure-as-code Templates

These are opinionated templates meant to facilitate faster development and provisioning of resources.
The templates are for various purposes such as deploying containers on ECS Fargate. 

These templates are still a work in progress. However, feel free to use the templates as a starting place 
in your own IaC resources.
